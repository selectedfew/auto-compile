On commandline to run, write the following:
>>> sudo python ./xapp.py
>>>
comp.sh and main.cpp...these files you use comp.sh to execute compiling main.cpp, no need to put all the arguments manually on terminal... just put stuff in a shell and run it as one command file.

tests.cpp and xapp.py also do the same where xapp.py being python is compiling and executing tests.cpp.
